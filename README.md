# documentation
These are the instructions in order to create the on-line documentation for your module.

* Create a docs/ folder in your module DS2 GitHub repository

* Dowload the template README.md in the template/ folder of the documentation repostory. This is the template for the module on-line documentation

* Use the template as it is. Don't change any section, just replace content 

* The template itself has the instructions to fill each of the sections

* In some cases, you may need to add N/A or To Be Done for some sections

* There are some examples in the instructions on how to include images. In order to name your images use the following convention MODULE-nameoftheimage where MODULE is the abbreviation of the module name ie. IDT-portal.jpg. Add all your images to an /images folder

* As an example, the idt on-line documentation is already published at <https://ds2-eu.github.io/documentation/modules/idt/>. Please see this example for additional guideline on how to create your sections. For the formatting of the sections, you can access the source code of the idt documentation at <https://github.com/ds2-eu/idt>

* Once the document is ready, push your updated README.md and the images/ folder to your module DS2 GitHub repository inside the /docs folder

* An automatic process will gather all the README.md from all modules GitHub repositories and compile them as a documentation site using material for mkdocs. The site is hosted at GitHub at <https://ds2-eu.github.io/documentation/>
